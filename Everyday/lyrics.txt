Yes I do
Yes I do
Yes I do
Yes I do

Verse: Em7 F#m7 Bm7b13

Baby, maybe
We can spend a little time together now that we're all alone
So long    I have been waiting
Now can't you let me take you home?

All these things we do
Will make our dreams come true
You want me and I surely want you
Tell me where to go
Tell me what I need to know
To take you on a little ride

Hold me, control me
Let me circumnavigate your body mind and soul
Like a, seed from a flower
I can grow and you must know
Sadness, don't mean a thing
'Cause you and me girl, you know we're in the swing
All the things that I want to get with you on a midsummer night
In the evening light, the sweet evening light

All these things we do
Will make our dreams come true
I want you, you want me
I surely need you baby
And so far what we've done
Has made our lives become
Something more than ....    Evening light to make it right
All, all I want from you baby
Is sweet loving now
No, I know, yes, I know
I know what I want from you girl hey
We can make it right
And we can hold onto each other tight
Lose your inhibitions
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Em7 (Cmaj7/F || F9#11) B75#

Every little thing we do is good
Every little thing you say is sweet
Every little part of you I'd like to meet
I want you girl, you know I want you
I want you in the evening light
