There's a man, runnin' hot
And there's a night train
I know he's gonna stick it out
Ride that crazy white horse

He's a man
He's a pig in paradise
But he might get blown into the weeds tonight

Seems like there's a record stuck
And man I couldn't make it up
He's a cool hand Luke
He's a duke on a slippery slope

He's dispossessed and crazy
Thank you for nothing baby
All those dreams are going up in smoke

I said
Hey Floyd, you got your mind in a mess again
Hey Floyd, you gotta learn how to break the chain

Oh oh, yeh eh

There's a night train to your heartbreak
Get on
It's the dream time
That's been driving you on

No more blue sky hanging over your head
So what you gonna do Floyd?
(Do Floyd)
I gotta know, gotta know what you're gonna do

What ya gonna do, what ya gonna do?
What ya gonna do Floyd? (do Floyd)
I gotta know, I've gotta know what you're going to do

There's a night train to your heartbreak get on
It's the dream time
That's been driving you on, and on

No more blue sky hanging over your head
No more blue skies hanging over you ooh

Come on Floyd!

Shoot 'em up and shoot 'em down
Cut down this bird of freedom
Kick it, stick it, doin' what you can

Gotta make the pieces fit
Get rid of all that shit
Floyd, you can't forget that you're a man

I said
Hey Floyd, you got your mind in a mess again
Hey Floyd, you got time on your hands to mend

Come on Floyd!
Gotta learn to break the chain down baby
Hey Floyd!
Gotta learn to break the chain down baby

Get off that shotgun ride
I know how much you tried
To blow the high priestess of pain away

You're a lone extravaganza
A dirty player and a dirty dancer
Hell man, you don't even know your name

Hey Floyd, you got your mind in a mess again
(You got your mind in a mess again)
Hey Floyd, you gotta learn how to break the chain
(Dirty player, dirty dancer)

Come on Floyd
(Dirty player, dirty dancer)
It's all I ask of you
(Dirty player, dirty dancer)
Come on Floyd
It's all I ask of you

Hey Floyd,
Don't get your mind in a mess again
