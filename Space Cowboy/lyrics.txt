Everything is good and brown
I'm here again
With a sunshine smile upon my face
My friends
Are close at hand
And all my inhibitions
Have disappeared without a trace
I'm glad
Oh that I've found oooh 
Somebody I can rely on.

This is the return
Of the space cowboy
  Inter-planetary Good vibe zone
Say at the speed of Cheeba
You and I go deeper
Baby I'm gonna have to get high just to get by

Now you know I got them
I get them Cheeba Cheeba space cowboy vibe

Everything is good, oh and green
Say I'm red again
And I don't suppose I'm coming down
I can see clearly
So High in the sky
A man with psychedelic picture frames
Of happiness to shade his eyes
He's glad
Oh That he found 
 Somebody he can rely on

This is the return
Of the space cowboy
  Inter-planetary Good vibe zone
Say, in the speed of Cheeba
Now we go deeper
You and I, you and I, you and I, hey ho

Now this is the return of the space cowboy
He's got that, he's got that, inter-plantery good
Vibe zone

Good times
High times
Good vibes
Hey, oh I like what you're doing there

*panting*, this time

Panting

This is the return
Of the space cowboy
Inter-planetary, Good vibe zone
Say, in the speed of Cheeba
We'll do deeper 
You and I  You and I

Now go deeper yeah
